# periodic-table-v1.0
A python project that generates a dynamic periodic table in Tkinter.

For manipulate all elements data, I used this API: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/14793990/TzmCgD9k

It was pretty difficult to set all buttons and labels dimensions. This project was made in Fedora 36. I will make a new version of this project so that it adapts Windows, Mac and other Linux distributions dimensions.

I applied Modular Programming so that the project is more readable and able to be modified efficiently.I tried to write this code as the cleanest way possible (I know it can be better) so I hope you understand each line of the programm.

That's all. I hope you like my work, feel free to ask anything you want and use this program as you want.
