# periodic-table-v1.0
A python project that generates a dynamic periodic table in Tkinter.

For manipulate all elements data, I used this API: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/14793990/TzmCgD9k

It was pretty difficult to set all buttons and labels dimensions. This project was made in Fedora 36. I will make a new version of this project so that it adapts windows, mac and other Linux distributions dimensions.
